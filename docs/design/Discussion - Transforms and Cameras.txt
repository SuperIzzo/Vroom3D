In the current setup we have a node tree, which will be part of a scene
graph, but for the time being it is just that, a node tree.

Each Node has 0 or more children.
A node will also have a parent, if I imitate Ogre3D design completely
there is one root note which doesn't have a parent and all other nodes
are created as children of other nodes
Transformation is multiplied backwards...
