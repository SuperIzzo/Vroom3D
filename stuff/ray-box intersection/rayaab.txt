
plane point = pp

pp.x = ray.x + ray.dir.x * t

t = ?
t = (pp.x - ray.x) / ray.dir.x

t

we also have to make sure that min is less than max

we do this a couple of times for each set of planes (3 in total) and at each round we get the maximal tmin and minimal tmax

if tmin > tmax then we failed

NOTE: in negative directions tmin and tmax switch places
